          <p className="p-2 px-4">Welcome to the bounty creation tool!</p>
          <p className="text-sm font-light p-2 px-4">
            This tool will guide you through the process of creating your
            bounties, any player will be able to claim them and obtain the
            reward once the bounty is submitted.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-light px-4">
            A bounty is a goal set by someone on a specific beatmap, once the
            goal has been reached by a player, he can attempt to claim the
            bounty and obtain the associated rewards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-light px-4">
            Following the multiple steps, you'll be able to see the creation
            progress using the bounty draft, aswell as the estimated gold amount
            that will be billed to you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm pt-2 px-4">A few guidelines to follow:</p>
          <p className="text-sm font-light px-4 ml-4">
            - The reward must be sufficiently high compared to your estimation
            of the bounty's difficulty to claim, however feel free to go as high
            as you want even if it's overkill.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-light px-4 ml-4">
            - The bounty must be at least remotely doable for someone as of some
            day, go crazy but don't be stupid and pollute the listings.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm p-2 px-4">
            To disclaim, any submission that goes against these guidelines can
            and will be removed from the listings without refund nor
            justification if it crosses the line.
          </p>
          <p className="p-2 px-4">Have fun creating bounties!</p>
